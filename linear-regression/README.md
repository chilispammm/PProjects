# Linear Regression: Car Price Prediction

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, and specifications.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Kaggle Car Price Assignment. It contains information about various car models including:
- Make and model
- Specifications
- Price
- Additional features
